          For 130 years, the Eiffel Tower has been a powerful and distinctive symbol of the city of Paris, and by extension, of France.
          At first, when it was built for the 1889 World's Fair, it impressed the entire world by its stature and daring design, and symbolized French 
          know-how and industrial genius. Paris is known for its gorgeous, imposing monuments. These iconic structures, often an exemplar of a particular 
          era in architecture, are one of the city's instantly recognizable elements. </p>
